Our project presents a detailed analysis and implementation of a recommendation system for a dress rental platform. Leveraging a dataset sourced from RunwayRent, the system aims to recommend dresses to users based on their preferences, occasion, size, body type, and age. The methodology encompasses content filtering, collaborative filtering (item-item and user-user), hybrid filtering, and advanced techniques including K-means clustering, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), K-means++, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and deep learning-based models. Additionally, embeddings and Multi-Arm Bandit Bayesian Ranking (MAB-BRP) are employed to enhance recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction.

The recommendation system is an integral component of dress rental platforms, facilitating personalized and relevant suggestions to users. By analyzing user interactions and dress attributes, the system aims to optimize user engagement and satisfaction. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the recommendation system's methodology, algorithms, and implementation details.
